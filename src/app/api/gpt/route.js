He refines his skills through mentorship and manages stress through gym workouts and playing football. His technical skills span programming languages like C, C++, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, along with expertise in libraries and tools such as React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and Git. He also has experience with cloud computing and DevOps, holding AWS certifications as a Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect, and is proficient in CI/CD pipelines. His work experience includes a Full Stack Developer Internship at Criss Cross Solutions, where he built a network monitoring tool achieving 99.9% uptime, a Software Engineer Internship at Delhi Web Hosting, where he optimized page load speed by 30%, and contributing to open-source projects through Social Winter of Code by developing Text2ReadMe, an automated README generator. Some of his notable projects include BackIt, a decentralized crowdfunding platform built with React, Solidity, and Thirdweb; a Multi-Threaded Proxy Web Server that improved web traffic handling by 40%; and The Daily Scribble, a MERN-based blogging platform with secure authentication and REST API integration. His achievements include being AWS Certified as a Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect in 2024, ranking in the top 500 in Flipkart Grid 5.0 out of over 4 lakh applicants, placing 1168th out of 33,382 participants in LeetCode Weekly Contest 413, and completing Goldman Sachs' Software Engineering Job Simulation in 2024.
